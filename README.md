# YOLOV8 Model for 3D Print Failure detection
## This is a Computer Vision Model created for finding and detecting failed 3D Prints.
Uses a self made dataset that comprises of successful and failed 3d prints
### Sample Images from the Dataset
![Sample of Image used in the dataset](https://github.com/omom77/3d_print_failure_detection_cv/blob/0c3c63bb79cfd435923b60855b161cbdefa3f076/training_results/sample_images_dataset/sample_image.png)
## Running the YOLOV8 Model
- Setup Environment
```
# Specify Python version
python3.10 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
- Run the print_failure_detection.py
```
python print_failure_detection.py
```
